( History of Usurper )


----------------------------
Version 0.25  (in development)
---------------------------- 
Versions:
- Compiling for DOS/GO32V2, Win32, Win64, Linux32, and Linux64 with Lazarus 2.0.12 / FPC 3.2.0.

Fixes:
- Crash with 0 byte MAIL.DAT file
- Revert to original SORTPL to fix USCORES generation
- Teammate(s) still present for fights when chased away by dogs while beer stealing 
- Weird bug where a zombie summoned by a monster in the dungeon would not have a target set, leading to killing the player but not actually killing them.
- Incorrect stats reported in EDITOR.EXE
- Divorcing did not properly detect when the user was not married
- Revert back from RMDoor to DDPlus, since Jakob inserted game-specific code into DDPlus
  - Fixes hitting ENTER not selecting default option on some menus, NPC events, and the /FMAINT and /HMAINT parameters asking for a name
- If displaying errors is disabled, don't pause when an error is encountered, because there's no error to read
- Pause after displaying Online Players when first logging in (waking up at Home would skip past this screen)
- Re-display main menu after viewing status, and aborting some actions
- Waking up at the dorm was displaying the menu twice
- Options that displayed a file (ie team scores, list of heros, news, etc) waited for a keypress before outputting each character in certain configurations
  - Noticed with Synchronet running on Linux in Socket mode
- Leveling up was applying the wrong master's attribute changes

Changes:
- Display on (S)tatus -> (M)ore updated (line things up and re-arranged other things)
- Statusbar disabled in local mode
- Update SendText method to write strings all at once instead of one character at a time (may help speed up display of some screens)
- Repurpose /X parameter to allow Linux Mystic sysops to disable socket i/o, since Mystic automatically redirects local i/o, which causes garbled screens
- Send stuff is now a global hotkey CTRL+S instead of hotkey '1' on the main menu
- Healing hut is now hotkey '1' instead of '2' at the main menu ('2' is still accepted though)
- Help (F1) disabled in EDITOR.EXE since it requires a new EDITOR.HLP file to be compiled, and I'm not sure how to for FreeVision
- DOC and DATA files will now be distributed in their subdirectory in the release archive, so Usurper will no longer move them at startup
- Main menu can be customized by editing TEXT\MAINMENU.ANS (and .ASC)
- USUTEXT.DAT is split into separate .ANS and .ASC files in the TEXT subdirectory, making it easier to customize screens
- Implement an @-code system similar to Synchronet's, to allow displaying variables in the TEXT\*.ANS and .ASC screens
- Status -> More can be customized by editing TEXT\STATUS_MORE.ANS (and .ASC)
- Level 100 players will have their drug addiction and mental stability improved at random (1 in 7 chance each maintenance run)
  - This is limited to level 100 players because players below that will have these values improve when they gain a level.
- Healing potion limit is enforced by spoiling 50% of the potions above the limit each maint run
  - For example if the player has 2000 potions and the limit is 100 potions, then on the next maint run (2000-100)/2=950 of the potions will be removed from the player
  - That will leave them with 1050, so on the next day (1050-100)/2=475 will be removed
  - This will soften the blow a bit for players who have acquired a large stockpile -- rather than remove them all at once, they'll have a few days to use at least some of them  


----------------------------
Version 0.24  (2015/09/01)
---------------------------- 
Versions:
-Only win32 and linux versions, now compiled with FreePascal instead of VirtualPascal, are supported

Bank:
-Your own team could fight you when robbing the bank. Fixed.

Cosmetics:
-Some typos fixed. Pause prompts added so that text doesn't scroll away.
-Tried to address a crash in Groggo's due to msg not being initialized.
-Fix maintenance crash due to unallocated variable during creation of TEAMREC.DAT
-Fix maintenance crash due to use-after-dispose bug in Gang Fights

Setup:
- If USURP.CTL does not exist, some (hopefully sane) defaults will be used.  (Makes testing easier since I don't have to keep recreating it after I wipe a directory)

Upgrading:
- As of 0.24 Usurper now includes an auto upgrader, built into EDITOR.  New versions will create a data file indicating the installed version when the game is reset, but old versions don't have that file so EDITOR will try to guess the installed version by looking at the NPCS.DAT file (which seems to change often).
- Currently upgrading is only supported for versions 0.20e and newer (excluding the W32 versions of 0.21 and 0.21a) -- if you want to upgrade an older game, then you'll have to handle the steps manually (download each release between your version and 0.20e and apply the updates one by one)


----------------------------
Version 0.23f  (2013/07/08)
---------------------------- 
Sorting:
-Sped up generation of player lists. (The shellsort Jakob used is fine but inefficient. I optimized the shellsort in one place but there are tons of duplicated copies of the code that should be fixed too.)

Text:
-Minor cleanup and spelling

Marriages:
-No more unrequited marriages created by maintenance. I think this is a bug I (Dan) introduced in my optimizations. NPCs will now never marry a human automatically; NPCs only marry other NPCs. Human-involved marriages will never happen automatically. (Thanks Brittany)
-No more getting tons of 'feelings' messages from NPCs every day.

Experience:
-Reduced default intimacy acts/day from 10 to 2. 10 is kinda ridiculous.
-Halved experience earned from beer stealing, since it gave way too much. (Thanks Alex)

Mail:
-No more receiving mail out-of-order. The upshot is that sending mail (including the reams of auto-generated mail) is much faster, but scanning for new mail will be slower toward the end of the day on busy systems. Mail is now automatically packed at the start of maintenance. (Thanks Rick)

Cosmetics:
-Depositing/withdrawing in the treasury doesn't accept values if you have no gold to deposit/withdraw (i.e. it works like the bank now)
-Cleaner level-raising text when you have the experience to raise multiple levels
-Some races/professions listed fake abilities that were never implemented (songs, dodge expert, immune to immortal gods). Removed. (I may implement some of these later, but for now they are just misleading.)

Inn player fights:
-Fight is now deducted if you die against doorguards
-Doorguards stayed dead if you killed some but died against doorguards, but all stayed alive if you killed doorguards and died against player. Fixed (dead doorguards stay dead)


----------------------------
Version 0.23e  (2013/04/27)
---------------------------- 
Pregnancy:
-Two mails could be received for a pregnancy (telling you that you and then your partner were pregnant). Fixed.

Scores:
-In the score ratings (equipment, weapon, armor, player killers, monster killers), deleted players caused gaps in numbering. Fixed. 

Status line:
-STATUS OFF in usurp.ctl to disable the status bar did not work. Fixed.
-Disabling the status bar screwed up inter-node processing (probably because status bar couldn't actually be disabled until my change above). Fixed.
-f1 toggle did not work when status bar was disabled. Fixed.

Maintenance:
-NPCs never bought around-body armour. Fixed.
-The NPC king could be recruited to an NPC team (so that he was king and in a team at the same time). Fixed.

Quests:
-When creating a quest, monsters would be listed multiple times (not aggregated like in the dungeons). Fixed.

Chest Items:
-Stealing items should not be available in classic mode. Fixed.
-Unimplemented (e)xamine chest option. Removed.
- 50% chance that home-owner sees you and initiates a fight, rather than 100% (a Jakob cheat that was left in by mistake). Fixed.
-Stealing should reduce dark deeds. Fixed.
-Player should only see you if alive and at home. Fixed.
-Should not be able to beg for mercy when seen stealing. Fixed.
-Stolen chest items show up as still available for stealing, but with *unknown* owner. Fixed.
-Player-owned items listed as owned by Pogo. Fixed.

Spells:
-Active spells were not reset before player fights. Fixed.
-Many spells did not work in player fights. Fixed, but I think this unbalances things (sage can use 'escape' spell and make the opponent miss for the rest of the fight). This is what Jakob intended (based on the code), but we'll work on balancing once I scrub all of the bugs.
-Angel caused dropped carrier in dungeon fights. Fixed. (Thanks Alex G)

Uman cave:
-Result of last-allowed indian wrestling was cleared before it could be read. Fixed. (Thanks Alex G)
-In Indian Wrestling, players started with strange power like 4/48. Fixed so that initial power and maximum are both the same initial power

Fake players:
-Garbage occasionally produced when checking (^w)ho is online. Fixed. (Thanks Alex G)


----------------------------
Version 0.23d  (2013/03/30)
---------------------------- 
***************RESET MONSTER DATAFILES***************

When upgrading to this release, you must use the editor to reset the monster datafiles. Choose Reset, then check the Monsters checkbox. The game will crash if you don't do this. Further details on why this happened below.

Maintenance:
-Maintenance with option #153 was slow. Fixed (wicked-fast now)

Monsters:
-For 20 years, monsters' defense was ignored, regardless of its value in the monster editor. I've now activated monster defense, but to keep the game the same I have explicitly set all default monsters' defense to 0. This means that this change does not affect anything unless you want to run a custom game where monsters have defense (since now the defense values in the monster editor will be honoured if you change them from 0).

Experience:
-Terrible bug where 10% of experience could be lost when both you and your opponent die in a teamfight. Fixed.
+Editor now allows float experience losses (e.g. 3.5%)
+Between 0 and 90% of experience can be lost now, as per the help text in the editor (before only 0-25% was accepted)

Prison:
-Players were told that they were imprisoned when failing to thieve in Bob's, but they were not. Fixed.
-When (e)scaping from prison, you were kicked out of the game instead of put on Main Street. Fixed. (I think Jakob did this because he was worried that the player would not be initialized correctly. I tried to fix that.)
-No more resurrecting players that are in prison

Home:
-(g)oing to sleep in home put you at main street on next entrance. Fixed.

Dungeon fights:
-Disease text was printed after player was dead. Fixed.

Gym:
-Dead or imprisoned players should not be able to defend the gym. Fixed.

Birthday:
-Infinite loop with (l)ove reward. Fixed.

Gangwars:
-Gangfights available should not be decremented when no one in rival gang is around to fight. Fixed.

Inventory:
-Trying to drop neck2 caused neck1 to be dropped. Fixed.
-Equipping a ring when both ring fingers were occupied always used the right finger. Fixed. (Neck is still messed up though.)
-Invalid numbers in the (s)top Using menu caused things to be dropped or inaccurate messages to be printed. Fixed.
-"decreased by +-5" ridiculousness fixed

Team Corner:
-Using invalid teamnames in certain places let you send messages to nonexistent teams, join nonexistent teams, etc. Fixed.

Online trading/dueling:
-These were mostly broken because fake player movement would break the initiation process. Fixed.

Marrying:
-Saying 'y' to paying for marriage when it was not a love-love relationship caused money to be wasted. Fixed (now it costs money only when marriage actually happens.) Found this one on an old Usurper forum.

Gods:
-Fixed horrendous bug that caused a player's god to be deleted if they simultaneously log-in on two nodes


----------------------------
Version 0.23c  (2013/03/03)
---------------------------- 
***************RESET MONSTER DATAFILES***************

When upgrading to this release, you must use the editor to reset the monster datafiles. Choose Reset, then check the Monsters checkbox. The game will crash if you don't do this. Further details on why this happened below.

Groggo's:
-When it was 'unfair' to cast a disease on someone, it was possible that follow-up questions would be asked anyway. Fixed.

ctrl+w:
-Fixed spurious "press return to continue" after checking who's online

Casting Spells:
-Reworking magic system to fix many bugs in player fights

Statistics:
-Pick-pocket attempts not shown in new mode. Fixed.
-Spurious options shown when viewing stats of other players. Fixed.
+Added player fights to statistics, and clarified "Fights" to mean "Dungeon fights"

Gym:
-Disabled dumb-bells option; Jakob wrote no code for this
+Gym now shows the owning team

Dorm:
-(p)ickpocket -> (p)otions -> kill opponent could result in a "you took 0 healing potions" message if your kill caused the opponent to waste all potions. Fixed.
-When (w)aking up the guests, you had a 2/3 chance of hitting an opponent, regardless of which move you selected (and independent of your close-combat skills). This, in combination with being able to choose the same move every time in Bob's, made it completely pointless to train anything besides knifehand. Fixed (now the chance of hitting in the dorm depends on close-combat skill).

Quests:
-NPC-created quests caused exception violation and fatal exit. Fixed.
-NPC quests could be created so that a "reward" is 0. Fixed.

Teams:
-Two different team rankings were being used: one in the team corner and one in the gangwars menu. Fixed to use the one that does not cause overflow (and hence huge positive and negative integer scores in the team score files).

Monsters:
-Of interest here is two monster attributes: hitpoints and strength. Strength is supposed to be the attack power, and hitpoints is the starting hitpoints. Unfortunately, Jakob did something so that hitpoints was always calculated as a monster's strength * 3. So regardless of hitpoint setting, it was ignored and set to strength*3. This severely limited the usefulness of the monster editor, since strength was in effect used to calculate strength and hitpoints. I have now changed the code so that it honours the hitpoints setting. The monsters that ship with Usurper have now been modified so that their hitpoints are strength*3, instead of 0 (but of course we know that the 0 was meaningless since strength*3 was hard-coded). This is why the monster datafiles must be reset. In other places in the code (such as dungeon events, joining alchemist order, fighting demon), Jakob's hitpoint values will now be honoured (rather than just using strength*3). I do not know the outfall of my changes in these circumstances, and will continue to test.

Dungeon:
-Removed duplicate "your share is..." messages when fighting alone in the dungeon
-When trying to join the orcs instead of saving the girl, you unintentionally saved the girl anyway. Fixed.

Bob's:
-Fixed loop in drinking competition when inviting new participants
-In drinking competition, if the initiating player lost then the "favourite" always won the competition and the competition ended with no further rounds. Fixed.

Supreme Being:
-Fixed crashes with too many hitpoints

Rick's change log:	
    -Fixed a problem where the statusbar was still drawn at certain points even if it had been disabled.
    -Fixed problem that caused Usurper to use an insane number of file handles (and caused lockups on Linux, which is how it was discovered).
    -Fixed some screen display issues when running in a console window with a buffer size larger than the screen size (possibly introduced after the last release, so maybe nobody experienced this)
    -Added support for native versions of Usurper on Linux and OS/2
	  -Linux was only quickly tested on Ubuntu 12.10 under Synchronet (latest from CVS).  It's important you enable STDIO and use the uppercase DOOR32.SYS.  The command I used was USURPER /P%n
	  -I have no method for testing OS/2, so if you try it out and run into problems feel free to contact me and I'll try to get things working.
	-Fixed a nasty bug that affected the DOS version of Usurper.  I made a typo when porting to Win32 that caused seemingly random crashes (which were stack overflows).  Typo is now fixed, so if you were experiencing problems with DOS Usurper 0.23 and newer, hopefully that's fixed now.
	-Added a help file for EDITOR32 (previously hitting F1 in EDITOR32 just gave an error message saying help was unavailable)
	-Changed delay routine since the old "Super Delay" routine would:
	 1) Use 100% CPU (or 100% of 1 core if on a multi-core processor)
	 2) Cause Usurper to intermitently crash with a run-time error 207 at startup


----------------------------
Version 0.23b  (2013/02/19)
---------------------------- 
Text:
-Fixed dozens of spelling mistakes. There are certainly many more.

Dungeon:
-Wishing well could give 0 strength. Fixed.
-L)ook could result in nothing (no fight and no event). Fixed.
-An event could follow the wishing well without having to do another look. Fixed.
-Optimized l)ook code

Steroids shop:
-Bad error causing steroid 10 to add very little strength and remove very little mental stability

Beer stealing:
-Experience was not properly split with teammate. Fixed.
-After stealing is complete, experience gained and number of dogs/sons killed was not reported accurately. Fixed.
-Dark deed was used up even when 0)abort was chosen. Fixed. (Now you can use the bones option to determine number of dogs without wasting a dark deed, but I think this is better than penalizing for aborting.)
-Son stamina was not reset when stealing again. Fixed.
-Dog order was only randomized when you r)eturned and then b)eer stealing. Fixed (now it randomizes every time you g)o)
-More exp is given now for knocking out sons (previously they yielded the same exp as dogs, but sons are much harder to kill)
-Number of dogs and sons killed is reported separately now

Dorm:
-If you had no dark deeds left, you could not pickpocket regardless of number of remaining pickpocket attempts. The strategy was then to pickpocket first, then use dark deeds later (since pickpocketting did not reduce dark deeds). Fixed (pickpocketting does not count as a dark deed)

Player fights:
-Alchemist poison was not included in the "You hit x for y damage" messages, even though it was correctly applied. Fixed.
-The player fight code is a mess, with duplicate copies of code all over. This has to be fixed.

Groggo's:
-Magicians, sages, clerics, and alchemists were supposed to be less susceptible to demons and diseases, but a nasty bug caused them to be _most_ susceptible. Fixed.

Maintenance:
-Fixed the "could not find street-talk files" message that began every maintenance session
-Sped up maintenance by reducing NPC marriage attempts

Daily News:
-Sometimes, the daily news would glitch and produces messages like
Rugwash,male,troll,barbarian
Fixed.

Bob's Beer:
+Added Man in Robes event. It was in the source, but not accessible.
-Apologizing to an 'insulted!' event resulted in getting kicked back to Shady Shops. Fixed.
-Brawls produced way too much stuff in the daily news. Fixed.
-It was impossible to have the best two thief statuses when trying (T)hievery. Fixed (now an assassin can eventually become a 'master thief')
-In the drinking competition, choice of drink did not influence anything. Fixed (now stronger drinks lead to shorter competitions)
-In the drinking competition, messages for out-of-competition participants were not shown. Also, 'glug' messages for participants were sometimes not shown. Fixed.

New Player Sequence:
-No more y/n on each behavior line entered. It was way too many questions for a new user, and they can change this behavior easily from the status screen.
-Stats was displayed twice for a new user. Fixed.
-New users were asked their opinion of the king, even though they can't possibly know anything yet. Fixed.

Mail:
-When you were not allowed to play further (0 res.), each (p)lay would read one remaining letter from the mail and then exit without giving you time to read the mail. Fixed.

----------------------------

---------------------------- 
Fixed
-Items can no longer be taken from characters at Beggars Wall (BigTrucker, Collins)
-NPC Rulers will not let themselves be hired/bribed to teams. (several)
-Made it more expensive to Bribe/recruite NCP characters to teams (papa zito)

 be able to do everything a player can do. However, right now NPC rulers only modify taxes and initiate Quests.

+It is now possible to send children to the Royal Orphanage when you are married (you need custody though).
 NPC spouses may divorce players on the spot for this action (the risk/chance for divorce is high).

 prepare to fist-fight your way to ownership. You do this by calling out the

 weight-lifting, lift beer barrels and flex their muscle. The crew in

 ladder to climb, with a lot of work needed to become the most worshipped
 one. See section on Immortals in Usurper.doc for more information.
+Relations. Some of the players actions will render automatic shift
 in attitude and behavior from the character subjected to them.
 NPCs remember all the wicked deeds they have been exposed to,
 and will act upon them. On the other hand, prosperous relations may
 result in marriage and babies. You can have fun and destroy others relations
 too. See section on Relations in Usurper.doc for more information.
+The King has the authority to dissolve or ban marriages
 (location: castle=>orders=>matrimonial decisions).

 orphanage the more gold the King has to cough up. An evil ruler may even
 decide to put the unwanted kids to the wolves.
 An ultimately wrong-doing Monarch may even force Your kids to the orphanage
 for no good reason.

+NPCS can usurp the throne (editor option 182). 
+children may be adopted (when both parents are dead)
+royal offspring get special treatment.

+added a routine which removes players who are falsely reported online.
 (usurper will remove players when their time limit have been exceeded).

 instead of Grimbold. Also fixed a bug where player didn't have to pay for
 his room if he also hired door guards. 
-improved file routines so semaphore files are updated correctly.
-fixed bug in online battle, where a player could hang up and thereafter
 log on and save his equipment.

 competition and no opponents were available.

-KING/QUEEN functions implemented, hereby making it possible for users and
 NPCs to attempt to usurp the throne. the king has a pretty good control over
 the Usurper world; he can make life miserable for the other players. The
 King (or Queen) may have his own Personal Guard Force and can also imprison
 citizens and even stage executions. But on the other hand the King might just
 be the good ruler who is loved by his people (not likely though, regarding the
 moral status of the general Usurper gamer) (see usurper.doc for more info).

 and \SCORES\MONARCHS.ASC. Assassinations, deaths, suicides, abdications and

-removed usurper.cfg and usurper.ctl from the archive. they only served the
 purpose of making people angry when their old config files were overwritten.

 same setup as in LORD. Usurper looks for DATA\BADWORDS.DAT file. See
 Sysop.doc for details. Sample file can be found in SAMPLES.ZIP
-improved file i/o error checking to all files used in the game.
-fixed as many spelling errors I could find. They are everywhere!

*A bounty hunter & assassin menu has been added to the game.
 Players can set rewards on other players or NPCs. The NPCs will
 hunt for bounties (The King can utilize this board in a special way).
 Reward money can be collected after singel or team battle. Offline
 players can of course also collect bounties, if they were to kill a
 wanted player.
 NPC bounty hunters will not hunt for teammates. However, the
 better the pay the more chances they will take to get the rewards.
 This means that low ranked NPCs can go on suicidal missions against a much
 higher ranked player. Of course, even though a high ranked player can beat
 ten minor NPCs, he may get whipped by the eleventh...
 Don't forget that the NPCs will set their own bounties :) So its wise to
 stay tuned to the wanted list, it can be profitable.

  Here players can put their found/conquered items for sale.
* Players can no longer manage the final monster by running away.

* Team leaders can control dungeon battles better now. Orders can be given
  to which monsters to attack.
* Computer controlled gangs can now be set to attack other gangs.

  This occured when the QUAFFING option (#22) was set to '2'.
* Players can now haggle in the weapon and armor store. Charisma is good
  to have in haggle situations. To be a troll is always good in the weapon
  store... Just one thing : don't push the shopkeepers around too much.
  If you mess with them the will mess with you!
* Fixed some bugs in the Brawl routines. Ted the Bartender is now
  removed from the fight correctly.
  Players can now ask for assistance in Brawlfights. This should
  only be done when you are in desperate need of help, since hired help
  in bars often tend to run away with your money or turn against you.
* Reworked some spells. Clerics DIVINATION spell is now more effective.
* Added a new store in the Marketplace. This one contains food and
  drinks (can there be surprises there?).

  day can set this with the new Editor option #87.
* Sysops can now set the game so players lose experience points in
  player versus player battles (editor option #90).
* Usurper can now be run in either OLD or NEW mode.
  the 'OLD' mode is similar to the older versions of Usurper.
  the 'OLD' mode gives the player one weapon and one armor.
  the 'NEW' mode gives the player many different kinds of armors (leg,
  body, feet, shields...etc etc).
  The 'OLD' mode has the same weapon and armor as the older versions of
  Usurper. It is also faster and simpler to play.
  This switch can be toggled in the middle of a game. But it's not
  recommended.
* The bank can now be robbed. Players can try for themselves or bring
  their team with them. To get to the safe a player must first defeat
  all the regular guards and then he might encounter other players, who
  has signed up as bank guards (and get paid for it).
  To become a bank guard a player must free from sin. Criminal elements
  are not tolerated.
  Players bank accounts are not affected by a robbery.
    *** Available in registered versions only ****
* Weapons bought in the store can now be used directly after
  purchase (same as with armor). The same goes for equipment
  bought in the magic store and stuff won in battle.
* Most of the menus are now hotkey sensitive.
* Expert menus are now optional. Can be toggled off/on in
  the players configuration menu.
* Output buffering can now turned off with the new
  command line option /NOBUFFERS. Output buffering is otherwise
  used by default.
* The Statusbar at the bottom of the screen can be turned off with :
  USURPER /NOSTAT.
  This speeds up screen operations a bit. Inside the game the statusbar
  is toggled by the Sysop with ALT-S or any function key.
* Running Usurper on multinode systems.
  New command line option : /P:{path to dropfile}
  Overrides path in .CFG file. Can be useful in multinode environments.
  Example : Usurper /P:C:\RA\NODE2\
  Examples on batchfiles are given in the file SYSOP.DOC.
  See also included sample : MULTI.BAT
* Removed the "sacking teammate" bug. Sometimes the program would
  generate a runtime error. Not anymore.
* Corrected the bug where "ghost" players followed down the dungeons.
  Monsters now pick REAL targets.
* Sysop Keys
  ALT-J shells out to DOS
  Arrow Up   increases the users time with 1 minute
  Arrow Down decreases the users time with 1 minute
  F4  - displays the above options.
  F10 - turns the status bar off.
* Players can now utilize the following key combinations :
   CTRL-W  who is online?
   CTRL-E  toggle Expert menus ON/OFF.
   CTRL-S  toggle 'outside attention' mode (more on this later on in this text)
   CTRL-T  display time remaining.
 (these keys can be used anytime and anywhere in the game)
* Added a 'ONLY 2 MINUTES REMAINING' warning, so players won't get
  thrown out in the middle of something.
* Reduced the effect of the SoulStrike.
* Corrected a heap of misspellings.
* Improved the Editor a bit ; Player spells can be edited.
                              Gender can also be changed now.
* Usurper is now multinode aware.
  File-locking is autodetected by detecting the presence of DOS's
  SHARE.EXE program which allows sharing of files by different nodes.
  If SHARE is detected the door assumes you are running a multinode BBS
  and locks/unlocks its files as needed. There may be a brief delay if 2
  or more nodes are running the door.
  Don't forget to supply the correct nodenumber on the
  command line : 'Usurper 1', for node 1
                 'Usurper 2', for node 2 ...
* Players can now battle each other online.
  Challenges are made from the "Challenges" menu.
* Players who are challenged offline or taken down the dungeons by
  their teamleader are reported online (in the "who is online").
  Their names are in a different color than the "real" onliners, and
  their node number is replaced with the text "GHOST".
  Player logged in locally have their node number replaced with the
  text "LOCAL".
  A character is not allowed to log in on more than one node
  simultaneously.
  A player can also be refused login because another player has
  challenged/brought him down to the dungeons.
  If this should be the case and you as player wants to join the action,
  You can always send a message to the online player telling him/her
  to let go of your character. This can be done from the Usurper Intro
  menu.
* Players can set their 'outside attention' level.
  This option is set from the configuration menu (players status screen).

   *All*      - This mode will display everything that happen in the game.
                Public and private messages, online challenges and
                info about when a player exits/enters the game.
                (DEFAULT MODE).
   *Personal* - Only listen to personal mesages and challenges.
                No public messages from online players will be displayed.
                No info about when a player exits/enters the game.
   *Quiet*    - Refuse to accept any messages/challenges. The user
                will play the game in splendid isolation.

Version 0.07 (1994-08-26)

(+) indicates changes since the 0.06 BETA release

+After having bought armors players are given the option to
 immideately start to use the new equipment, without having
 to enter the status display.
+Maximum number of players that Usurper can accept has been raised to 300
+Fixed messy score files
+Alchemists can now check if their weapons are poisoned in the
 status screen.
+Recompiled Usurper with a new version of JpDoor
+Three rating lists have been added to the 'Score Corner' :
   Weapon Masters Hall of Fame (whos got the best weapon value)
   Armor Masters Hall of Fame (whos got the best armor value)
   Equipment Masters Hall of Fame (whos got the most powerful equipment)
+All rating and score lists are now produced in both ansi and ascii
 formats. With the Editor sysops can easily configure filenames and
 paths for every file.
+Producing all scorefiles upon every exit of Usurper can take some
 considerable time on slower systems and in games with alot of players.
 By setting config option #84 to "No" Usurper must be forced to produce
 any defined scorefiles. This can be done with the command line option :
 'Usurper /scores'. (To produce the extra scorefiles a registrated version
  of Usurper is required)
+Sysops can now decide whether the losers of Beer Drinking Competitions
 and Brawls should be locked out from further gaming that day.
 (can be changed in the configuration, #85 and 86)
+Changes have been made to improve performance on systems with highspeed
 modems and multitaskers.
+Usurper now shows the correct node number at the status bar (lower right
 corner).
+Running Usurper /M (forced maintenance) no longer requires a dropfile
 to be present.
+The first computer Team (Close Circle) will have a randomly created
 password at every reset. This to prevent players from joining the team
 and gain advantage.
+A new command line option has been added. By using '/DEBUG', sysops can
 more effectively track down their problems with Usurper. A logfile will
 be created under the name : DebugNNN.jpd, where NNN is the node active
 (DEBUG001.JPD for node 1, DEBUG002 for node 2...).
+Maximum number of players is now 300.
+The Statusline now shows both the players handle and real name.
+Another new command line option is '/SNOOPOFF'. This will prevent any
 output to the local console.
+Added more info to the user when maintenace is being performed. This to
 prevent users from believing that the game has bugged out.
+New option in Usurper.cfg (#67). Automatic Maintenance can be toggled
 On/off (default is ON). By disabling automatic maintenance Sysops can
 decide when they want to run their daily maintenance.
+New option in Usurper.cfg (#68). Resurrection of dead players at
 maintenance can now be toggled on/off (default is off). Turning this
 to ON can make some games more interesting, with many targets for players
 to attack after midnight.
+New option in Usurper.cfg (#69). A line is offered here for Sysops to
 give Credits to users for helping out with registering Usurper, or
 something else that has helped the game (only works in registered
 version).
+Fixed Bank bug, where players accidentally could overflow their
 accounts, or withdraw more than 2,000,000,000.
+'Grabbing items' logic has been changed. Objects are not placed auto-
 matically in left or right hand/fingers, as they were before. A bug in
 the 'stop using item' function has also been fixed.
+Monsters absorbation will no longer increase during long battles.
+Dungeon monsters have been made a bit tougher.
+Removed some nasty bugs that casused Usurper and Editor to bug out with
 a Error 162 message.
+Team members not allowed to join the dungeon fighting will now
 stay home (they insisted on tagging along in the 0.06 release)
+The 'drop all' command will not allow cursed items to be dumped.
+Magic Users will now continue to fight in the dungeons when their
 mana is low. In the 0.06 release they just stood and watched when
 they had used their mana. Now, they will also mix their magic with
 normal attacks, making the battles more realistic/interesteing/unpre-
 dictable
+Dead players will not appear any more in Beer Drinking competitions.
+Speeded up Beer Stealing procedure. Thieves can now carry more barrels
 depending on how strong they are. Real strong players can carry up to
 eight barrels in one go. The nasty bug where you got a negative amount
 of money when stealing ALL barrels has been removed.
+Armor Shop menu has been cleaned up to provide easier access.
+Players who commit suicide can write their own suicide notes.
+Characters now hold their personal "kill records". Monster kills/defeats
 and Player kills/defeats have been added to the statistics.
+Hitting 'R' from the main menu give players the option of viewing
 statistics of all kind, and comparing their own records with other
 players.

*Whole teams can now enter the dungeons to fight monsters!
 It's quite fun to bring down your mates for a little ride
 downstairs... Hear them scream and brag after every little pathetic
 effort they think they have accomplished. Or hear them scream for
 help when they are laying stunned on the ground, with twelve laughing
 monsters beating the hell out of them.
 However, the real winners can be (online) low level characters
 going down with their high level teammates. The other way around is
 not so favourable to the lower level characters. One hit from a mighty
 monster can put small timers to sleep quite quickly...
 (can be toggled OFF/ON with the Editor)
*All weapons and armors from earlier version have been discarded.
 Usurper now supports a "full equipment" system, which means that
 players can dress up their characters with different armors and
 weapons. They can buy gloves, boots, pants, helmets, belts and much
 more to give them better protection/equipment.
 (Don't worry about players old weapons/armors! They are cashed in when
  the conversion program is executed.)
*To increase the flexibility of Usurper, an Object Editor has been added to
 the Editor program. Approximately 500 objects are included as default.
 However, sysops are free to create their own, or edit existing,  objects
 with the Object Editor. Make your own weapons, armors, food, drinks,
 magic stones, poisoned potions, cursed instruments or any
 other strange items you can think of. You can of course write colorful
 descriptions to every Object. Hidden information can also be included.
 Objects can be configured to be monster weapons only, or only be available
 in the shops, or they may be set to be found in the dungeons at certain
 levels. It is also easy to create a "only one of its kind" type of object.
 If, for example, a very powerful weapon is created, the Sysop can give it
 to an NPC or a player and then toggle the Objects existance in the
 shops/dungeons to OFF. Now the rest of the players probably want to have
 a little "chat" with the lucky owner to this unique weapon. Players can
 also be given special items after acheieving specific goals.
 The above are only suggestions on how to make the game more challenging.
 The real possibilites are restricted by your imagination alone.
 Up to 65,000 different objects can be created and used.

 <> Programmers Personal <>
   Personally, I must admit that the making of new objects, especially
   articles of clothing, has been the most enjoyable part in the making
   of Usurper so far. And since the NPC:s do their own shopping, the
   joy can be extended when watching how THEY dress. I don't know if
   you must have special kind of humour to appreciate the occasion when
   Ugluk comes rushing at you, wearing a Sombrero, jeans and ray-bans.
   However, the default objects included in this package range from serious
   articles to a number of more bizarre items. I like both types.

*Don't forget to configure which items that shall be able to be taken
 from defeated players. You can configure everything individually.
 Personally, I don't recommend setting everything to YES, meaning that
 a victor can take ALL the defeated players equipment. It's quite GRIM
 to loose sixteen items in one go! However, being a real sadist, why not
 allow the victor to take the defeated players inventory as well. The game
 can be configured that way...if you like.
*Difficulty for teams in dungeons can be changed with the Editor.
*Sysops can now easily change the "xp needed to level" limits with the Editor.
*Dungeons events have been reworked. The "get the treasure or die"
 choices have been discarded.
*Sysops can now create their own doorguards with the Editor.
*Players can hire up to 10 heavy doorguards to protect themselves.
*Players can now start their own Beer drinking competitions;
 Challenge your friends/foes and see who can drink the most beer!
*Players can now create their own cocktails at Orbs Health Club.
*Sysops can now choose if they want to use Fossil Drivers or NOT.
*Sysops can now decide if Usurper should load itself into EMS memory
 or not. By default Usurper will not load itself into EMS. If you
 want to use EMS memory then use the commandline option : Usurper /EMS
*Sysops can now change maximum number of players allowed in the game.
*Maximum number of healing potions that can be carried, can be changed.
*Name of Dungeons can now be changed in Editor.exe / Edit Config file.
*Include NPC:s level raises in the daily news is now optional.
 Change this switch in Editor.exe / Edit Configuration file
*NPC:s can now buy new weapons/armors/equipment, when they have the money.
 This can be toggled ON/OFF in the Editor.
*Players now have some more configurable phrases which are used in battle.
*Monster Editor has been improved. It is now possible to edit monster
 weapons, strength, resistance to magic, iq and more...
*NPC:s can now be (e)xamined in the Dormitory.
*Players can now set their own standard battlecries. This is mostly shown
 during teamfights against monsters.
*Prices have gone down at Groggos.

*Many many bugs fixed.
*Recompiled Usurper with JpDoor 4.1

Version 0.05 BETA (1994-03-20)
*Added A Monster Editor to the Main Editor.
*Sysops having problems with their Usurper configuration file can now
 create it from the Editor (by answering simple questions).
 NOTE! In this version there are many new configuration possibilities,
       so I recommend that you use the editor configuration program to get
       it all right.
*Backstabbing in the dungeons now works.
*The Game can be configured to make all NPC:s available in the Dormitory,
 thus possible to challenge and defeat (switch in Usurper.cfg).
*Healing Center has been implemented.
*The armor basevalue can now be set freely ( 0-60 % ). A value of 10 means
 that all armors absorb 10% of their armorvalues as a base value. The higher
 you set this figure, the more effective the armors get  (default is 25%).
*Sysops can now decide how they want the Healing procedure to work
 in the dungeons : (what happens after a player quaffs healing potions)
  1 : Player quaffs potions and then autoattacks monster
  2 : Player quaffs potions, and then the monster gets a free attack round
  3 : Player quaffs potions and can then choose another option
*Starting money for new players can be changed in the Usurper.cfg file.
*Number of Teamfights a player can perform can now be changed in the
 Usurper.cfg file
*Names of shopkeepers and levelmasters can now be changed in the .CFG
*Removed the ugly bug where non-team players couldn't buy armors and
 weapons.
*Sysop can now decide how much Experience a player will loose when he dies
 in the dungeons. This can be set for different levels.
*The monsters in the dungeons now speak again (optional). Monster weapons
 are also displayed during battle (as in earlier versions).
*Monster weapons have been made more powerful (thus more attractive
 to swap)
*Local login now works as before, with /L as command-line switch.
*Usurper can now be run in a "soft" mode. SOFT mode replaces drugs,
 steroids, snuffing, whorehouse and gigolos with more decent social
 activities (like burgalry and such =). Change this option in
 Usurper.cfg. Running in Normal modes gives you these new options
 additionally (look at Dark Deeds Menu for example...)
*Beer stealing and kidnapping are new options in Dark Deeds menu.
*Every time maintenance is run a CHAMPION is selected by comparing
 every players statistics. Not only high level characters can
 win this title. The values are based on what level you are, so a
 low level character with extremely good base stats can take the title.
 (you can also see a top 50 list when pressing 'O' from main menu)
*Removed a bug which messed things up a bit when sending items to team-
 mates.

Version 0.04c : (1994-03-02)

 the .CFG file)

* New abilities added : Stamina, Agility, Charisma, Dexterity, Wisdom and
  Mana.
* 14 different close-combat skills added.
* Increased abilities upon level raises now depends on which Class the player
  belong to.
* Some new offline behaviour can be configured.
* You can now write your personal description of your character.
  This will be shown every time another player look at you.
* Monster weapons can now be taken from successful battles.
* Added more dungeon events. Made them a bit more flexible than the old
  ones. As a result of this the dungeons have become more dangerous and
  challenging. You cannot go down and just expect to kill your daily number
  of monsters without getting into some serious trouble.
* Drug addiction and Mental Stability stabilizes when players perform
  a level raise.
* Drug addiction and Mental stability parameters affect battles more
  now. Lack of concentration and hallucinations are common problems.
  Worst case scenarios are players with VERY low mental stability.
  These nutcases can actually rise at midnight and do things they
  never would have done in a healthy mode. They can also experience
  hallucinations when they play.
* New ANSI intro screen. Thanks to Jerry Barham at Crimson Knight BBS.
* The configurable option where your character would buy healing
  potions after every successful battle now work as it should.
  When you log on, you will get a notice of each one of these
  auto-purchases.
* Attacking Akrappa, the levelmaster, is no longer possible.
* Added some new items that can be found. You might for example find
  Drug Darts. This can be thrown upon an enemy and cause his drug
  addiction to raise (Not a very nice thing to do!).
* New Shop added. The mad mage Groggo sell services to those who wish
  to get rid of an enemy, but don't dare/have the muscles to fight for
  themselves. Groggo can summon Demons against your foes, he can curse
  them and give them diseases. The prices are quite reasonable, but
  be careful! The old mage is very old, angry and vicious. He might do
  things to players just because he woke up in a worse mood than usual.
* As mentioned above, players are now affected by diseases. There are
  different types of diseases, with the Plague as the most horrible.
  Try to stay healthy! Diseases are not easily cured...
* New Pub added. Bobs Beer Hut is a shady place where you can go if you are
  looking for trouble. Brawls and thievery are common activities.
  (This is function is only available in Registered programs)
* The money receieved for City Control is now totally dependant upon
  the gangmembers abilities. That is : the higher level a player has,
  the more money for City Control. The money are summed up and thereafter
  equally divided among the teammembers. A level 2 character will therefore
  recieve the same amount as his teammate with a gamelevel of 50.
* There are now 10 Levelmasters (Akrappa included). Players choose a
  master to study for. They can change teacher whenever they want, but it
  will cost a pretty grim sum of money. Different masters are good at
  different things and will teach differently. It's a good idea to
  experiment. Some players prefer raw strength, and other need spellpower.
  It much depends on which class a player belong to.
* Loosing a fight, or just dying in general, reduces a players
  experience points by approximately 5%. This will only affect players
  online.
* Magical items, such as Rings, now works in Dungeons.
* Suicide option now works properly.
* Viped out a bunch of nasty bugs. Cleaned up the code a great deal.
  The size of Usurper.exe file has been reduced. However, the total size
  of Usurper continues to grow.
* The number of teamfights a player can perform have been reduced
  to three.
* Sysops can now edit/add/change the NPCs (requested by many).
* Many minor changes have slipped my mind (you will notice them
  sooner or later).

Version 0.01f : (1993-10-08)
(To all Sysops : follow the instructions in the 'README!' file!)
I recognized a couple of situations where the program
would bomb out. These have been corrected.
* All races can now REALLY resurrect teammates.
* NPC Wizards now cast spells in gang combat.
* 'Fight to death' option added.
* Magical items can be purchased, others can be found. Many of these can be
  very useful in battle, others are dangerous.
* Items can now be sent to NPC:s (useful to increase team strength).
* More computer characters have been added (big and tough guys).
* More detailed info on NPC:s.
* Gnoll poison effect is now stronger, depending on which level
  the Gnoll is on.
* New players can choose to be males/females. Gender support
  also added in text.
* Flee the dungeons now works properly.
* Beg for mercy in the dungeons now works.
* Players can configure some offline combat behaviour.
* Lockups due to repeated keypressing are now gone.
* Many small bugfixes and changes that i can't remember. And of course
  some cosmetic enhancements.

Version 0.01e : (1993-09-21)   *** FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE ***
All races can resurrect teammates. Players can quit in
'Begging mode'. This will place them on street disguised
as beggars. Money can be earned. But as beggars are unarmed
other players can easily have them murdered. However,
murdering beggars are not good for character and will not
yield much experience. 'The Castle' option has been replaced
with 'The marketplace', where various actions can be made.
Reworked the battle formulas in player-vs-player battles.
Troll players now have more problems when recruiting
good characters, as paladins and elves. Certain races
just can't stand each other...
Non-Player-Characters now form teams when they feel like
it. Players can have a maximum of 250 healing potions.
Rival gangmembers can now be bribed over to your team.
A way to avoid teammembers from being bribed is to send
them items/money making their loyalty increase.

Version 0.01d : (1993-09-10)
Computer controlled characters now uses Soulstrikes more
efficiently. The Paladin character has been made more
powerful. Send items to teammates now works. NPC:s increase
their abilities as their experience goes up.
A couple of more dungeon events added. Weapons and armors
can be taken from dead oppponents in player/team fights.
Add to that numerous of small changes and bugfixes.

Version 0.01c : (1993-09-01)
Added a Wishing Well in the dungeons. 'Good' characters
will recieve rewards from the King. Stay-Alive Bonus to
all characters who makes it through the day alive.
Made life a little bit easier and rewarding in the dungeons.
Added options to send items between teammates. Computer
players now a bit trickier to beat. Usurper now also includes
numerous of computer characters who can be sworn into your
team and do some of the fighting! And of course some bugfixes.

Version 0.01b : (1993-08-29)
Minor bugfixes. New options : Resurrection of teammates.
Teams can now also fight each other without city control
involved.

Version 0.01  : (1993-08-22)
First shaky release on my own BBS, Silent Service.
Some bugs noticed.

in April, 1993)
