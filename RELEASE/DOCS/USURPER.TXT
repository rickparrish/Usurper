   Usurper the DoorGame
   ---------------------
    ---------------------

Welcome to Usurper, a fantasy game filled with fast paced action, violence
and instant death. This game has only one purpose : to give you a good time
without the need of reading any lengthy documentation. You can actually
enter the game and go berzerk straight away. However, you can consider
 continuing to read and perhaps learn something that can keep you alive for 
a while. 

You can choose to play as a lonewolf adventurer/warrior who seek gain only for
yourself, and care little for anything else. You can also form teams in which
you and your comrades fight for each other. In either case you should always
concentrate your efforts on the dungeons. It's in these huge cave
areas that your fortune can be made, or your life end...
There are over one hundred dungeons stretching from the top of the huge
mountain, down to it's deepest level. It may be said at once that no creature
has ever returned from the deeper levels. The ancient legends say that on
Durunghins bottom there is a "thing" so powerful that the worlds destiny
can be altered with it. But the legends also say that the guardians of this
"thing" goes beyond everything your worst nightmares can bring forth...
Well, no one has ever reached beyond the magic 90th level--you might be the
first. You can take your team with you to the dungeons. It is almost always
better to have more than one to face those monsters.

Completing the final challenge at the bottom of the huge mountain will reward
you with immortalization in the chronicles. Your name will live forever.

It is important to note that in the dungeons, many strange creatures lurk
around. Some will eventually approach you and offer different things. Your
response will ultimately lead to either riches or to death...

If you don't fancy strolling down the dungeons, you can do other things.
You can visit the Dormitory, where many of the characters take their rest.
You can kick them out of their beds and challenge them for a fight, or perhaps
try to murder them while they sleep... 

You will always have opponents in this game, not just the monsters you
challenge in the dungeons, but also computer controlled characters.
These guys are not always nice. Some will try to slain you just for the
hell of it! The dungeon monsters, on the other hand, are always there 
waiting for you.



Team Play
---------

A nice feature of Usurper is the team function. If they wish, players can
form gangs/teams and seek their luck together. The gangs can be used to
gain control of the town, which in its turn can add income to the members.
Controlling the town brings your team money, but remember that everything
has a price. Every gang wants to beat the leaders. You don't just have to
worry about other player gangs. There are also computer teams that
are waiting just to whip the senses out of you and your comrades. If you don't
trust the other players you can hire in computer characters to fight for
your team. Don't trust them too much though as most of them can be turned
when offered the right sum of money...  
Other teams can at all times challenge the town controllers. Gangfights are
mostly short, bloody and dirty. It is recommended that you let your teammates
know before you take them out to a street massacre where they risk to lose
everything, including their lives.

Teams can also enter the dungeons together. This can be a good way to
help fellow members to raise their experience. After a successful battle
you can take them to see their levelmaster, and raise their level.



Character Creation
------------------

Upon the creation of a new player you will be given the opportunity to
choose between different races and classes. This selection is vital to
the type of game you will be involved in. First of all, every race and
class has different abilities according to strength and defence, but
they also have different values when it comes to 'valor' and 'darkness'.

Take a paladin for example. This character is aimed for goodness, and should
be played good. That means that you should spare innocent victims, perform
quests of valor, and thereby raise your valor. However, the paladin can also
be played bad, and perform violent acts such as murder innocent creatures and
visit whorehouses. Unfortunately your characters deeds will eventually catch
up with him. In the case of the paladin this will cause his soul to darken,
and eventually something terrible will happen. But of that i will not discuss
anything more here.
If we take another character like the troll, this creature can and should
be played bad. To be vicious and commit evil deeds will raise the trolls
darkness score, and eventually reward him. But it must be said that
you can experiment whith different combinations, as none is totally 
predictable. If you want the ultimate killing machine, consider the
choice of Troll as race, and Barbarian as class. 

Also remember that every race and class has their own special abilities.
The Gnoll has a poisoned bite. The Paladin can at extreme situations
use a so called soul-strike, this is a blow where he use some of his
hitpoints to create a kind of superblow. The Paladin has this ability
due to his strong virtue. In difficult situations he can concentrate
this force and use it to achieve maximum performance. However, a good
Paladin can achieve greater than a dark paladin. The strike can be used
when you want a quick solution in a battle against a stubborn foe, or
in a situation where you have little hope to stay alive. The 'soulblow'
is a VERY risky business though. If you use all your hitpoints in a
strike, an enemy can easily defeat you... 

Races :
 Humans     - good overall choice.
 Hobbits    - great rangers.
 Elves      - builds mana faster than other races.
 Half-elves - more robustly built than the elves.
 Dwarves    - make great warriors.
 Trolls     - big and strong.
 Orcs       - great as fighters and magicians.
 Gnomes     - good in combination with alchemists and assassins.
 Gnolls     - poisonous bite. unfortunately with a rather weak constitution.
 Mutants    - ...?

Professions :
 Alchemists  - can poison their weapons.
 Assassins   - backstabbing is their trade.
 Barbarians  - raw strength is favored among the barbarians.
 Bards       - "masters of soft voices". In the beginning the bards are
               fairly innocent. However, with accumulated experience, the
               songs learned from the singmasters will prove as
               useful as the sorcerors spells. Bards are invaluable in
               team-play, since they can boost morale.
 Clerics     - spell masters.
 Jesters     - jesters are very hard to hit.
 Magicians   - spell masters
 Paladins    - should be played GOOD. Have soulstrike as special weapon.
 Rangers     - excellent stealth qualities. Hard to hit.
 Sages       - spell masters.
 Warriors    - the standard fighter class.

Dungeon Events
--------------
In the dungeons you will sometimes bump into individuals and creatures
with not just fighting on their mind. 
Some will just be out to make fun of you. Others will try to trick you
into an early grave. Most encounters will be short, but there are a few
exceptions where you will have the opportunity to participate in a mission
where high politics is often involved. Your success on these missions is
vital for the chance to ever get another chance. So, keep your mission record
on the plus side (it can turn negative). Don't play with spies and diplomats
when you are a low level character. And never lie to Ragmoth.



Bards *with new ability for version 0.18
-----
The bards should no longer stand back to the other classes in Usurper.
You should be a team-player if you choose this class. The bard is best
used in team-battles where he/she can heal a team in one turn!

The bards learn a new song for every 10th level...it is a hard job to aquire
the experience to deliver the ancient myths. Awakening the spirits in the
audience is a tough job. Be it for good or evil, the Bards actually
learn 2 new songs for every 10th level. One song is a violent attack song,
the other one is a soft healing hymn...perhaps useful in romantic situations
as well. Be aware though, the songs on the higher levels are so powerful that
immortal deitys can accidentaly join in to experience the artist. And you
never know what they might come up with.

The King
--------
Characters with a certain level can attempt to usurp the royal throne.
The task is easy if no king or queen exists. Should that be the case,
you will get the title without struggle.
Should a king already be in rule,  you will have to infiltrate the castle
and try to remove the current ruler (assassinate or something).

pros and cons with being king;
(+) 
    you are the top gun in the game, isn't that enough?
    you can close and open establishments (shops).
    you can enforce new taxes.
    you have the power to order the Court Mage to impose his magic (good or
    evil). The Royal Magic is very powerful, since you can be a decisive force
    in ongoing events.
    You have the authority to dissolve or ban marriage.
    you will have the pleasure of having other players crumbling in the dust
    before you. You will hear them scream when they swim across the moat and
    find out about the surprises you have put there.
    you can put other players kids in the royal orphanage.
    you can imprison (and execute) other players.
    you can sleep safe at the castle (until you are deposed).
    you can't go to prison! You stand above the law.
    other players can't spy on you, or attack you.

(-) you cannot be in a team when you are king.
    people wont appreciate you for the taxes, which you might have to set
    if you want to be able to hire soldiers (security). 
    you have responsibility for the law and the proper behaviour of your 
    subjects. (you can of course be a bad king, but people will probably
    remove you from office if you act mean and vicious)
    you must take care of all orphants produced by irresponsible parents! 
    a lot of people will hate your guts whatever you do.
    you will probably be assassinated.



The Immortals
-------------
When a player completes his doings on earth, he may choose to retire from
Usurper altogether, or ascend to the world of the immortals (heaven).
Should you decide to become a immortal it does not imply immediate supreme
powers and "almightyness" at your fingertips. Contrary to popular belief, life
in heaven can be hell.



The Relations
-------------
As soon as you do something nice or bad to another player/npc this will
be recorded and affect your relation with that character.
All of this will, of course, play a part later on when you want to bribe or
recruit a team-member or have a love-affair. The Npc's are more predictable 
in their shift in attitude. They get annoyed when attacked and pleased when
you help them. But don't be foolish and think that you can kill Ugluk 50
times and then send him a million bucks and everything will be well.
These guys remember exactly how many times you have done wrong and the
grudges are nursed until it's time to settle the old score.

You can marry another player/npc when you both are in love with each other.
The matrimonial bond carries benefits; You get extra experience.
You can have kids. Your spouse can be nice to you (if you are lucky).
The drawbacks are mainly related to the kids. They can be kidnapped, put
in an orphanage or even die (causing grief and anxiety). 
Having forced sex with other players/spouses can prove to be most
detrimental to yourself. Watch out especially for npc characters, who tend to
pay back as soon as the clock passes midnight :)


Raising children is an expensive business. If you can't afford to pay
for their upbringing, your offspring will be sent to the Royal Orphanage.
This means that the royal treasury must spend tax-money on an ever
increasing number of kids. The King might be generous and take care of
the little rascals for a period of time, but he can also decide to
put the babies to the wolves or something...
Should the royal treasury not hold enough funds to sustain the children
then they will starve and ultimately die...
Your enemies may try to harm your offspring by poisoning, kidnapping or
beating them. There are ways to protect your children though.

If you should decide that a divorce is the way to go, then keep in mind
that custody of your children will go to the other parent!
Your children will get depressed from a divorce. That is not good.

A husband can never attack his wife (and vice versa), except in team-fights.
You can trick other players by sending them "gifts" with poison or
other scary stuff inside.


Shortcuts to Success
--------------------

* Are you the type of player who wants to achieve faster progress than the 
  normal monster and team bashings can result in? 
* Are you the type of player who can do almost anything just to beat
  the others?
* Are you willing to risk everything in these attempts?

If you answered yes to all of the questions above you should read further.
If you answered no to one or more of the questions : why not read this anyway?

First of all, there are good and evil acts that can give you experience and
money. They can, of course, give you pain and death as well. Most important of
all, though, they influence your soul. Every bad act darkens your soul, and
every good lightens it. Swinging either side over the limit will give you some
unpredictable and sometimes fatal consequences. Some races can withstand good
or evil better than others, and can therefore benefit longer. 

Usurper is not a normal and restricted Fantasy game. It includes some more
modern features too. Ever heard of drugs and steroids? Well, here they are.
There are many different types of drugs in this game. They all have two things
in common though. Firstly, they send you into dreamland where you can receive 
hallucinated experiences which add to your earlier experience. Drugs also
increase your addiction to narcotics. You should be very careful not to
turn into a junkie, cause if you start to stuff yourself full with drugs
every session, you'll soon enter your final dreamland. Keep an eye on your
-Drug Addict- parameter and also remember that drugs occasionally give
you bad trips, or can even kill you with an overdose...      

Steroids will not give you any experience. They will, however, give you
what you are always going to need in these kind of games : MUSCLES. 
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to crack those enemy bones just as easy as
you pull the wings of a fly? Well, buy some steroids and you will (never)
regret yourself. Steroids comes in many different types. The results on
your body will show at once! Just keep an eye on your -Mental Stability-
parameter. It will show when you're about to crack. And please try not to
fool yourself with these pills. Psychos are not treated kindly in this game.


Good Luck in Your Quest!
