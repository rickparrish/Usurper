Step 0) Assumptions:

	The first assumption is that you have Borland Pascal installed in Z:\BP.  
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDBP.CMD file

	The second assumption is that you have Virtual Pascal installed in Z:\vp21.
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDVP.CMD file

	*NOTE* The BUILD*.CMD files will copy a BPC.CFG or VPC.CFG into the relevant bin directory, meaning
	if you have cusomized the .CFG file in the bin directory, it will be lost.  Make a backup!

Step 1) Create directories to hold everything:

	Z:\Usurper
	Z:\Programming\Usurper
	Z:\Programming\Usurper\EXE\BP
	Z:\Programming\Usurper\EXE\VP

	If you don't have a Z: drive, you can use SUBST or map a network drive to fake one
	You can also put the files in an alternate location if you want, you'll just have to update the BUILD*.CMD scripts

Step 2) Get the source

	Check out the GIT contents into Z:\Programming\Usurper

Step 3) Edit Z:\vp21\source\tv\dialogs.pas

	TLabel.HandleEvent has a bug that will cause EDITOR32 to crash.  So go to line 2068, which should be:

    C := HotKey(Text^);
    if (GetAltCode(C) = Event.KeyCode) or
       ((C <> #0) and (Owner^.Phase = phPostProcess) and
        (UpCase(Event.CharCode) = C)) then FocusLink

	And wrap it in a check to see if Text is assigned.  In other words, replace it with:

    if Assigned(Text) then
    begin
      C := HotKey(Text^);
      if (GetAltCode(C) = Event.KeyCode) or
         ((C <> #0) and (Owner^.Phase = phPostProcess) and
          (UpCase(Event.CharCode) = C)) then FocusLink
    end;

Step 4) Edit Z:\vp21\source\rtl\vpsysw32.pas

	For some reason the cursor position isn't always updated in the background thread in the Win32 version.  I'm guessing
    it's a race condition with the CurXPos and CurYPos variables, so the thread doesn't think an update is needed when
    one really is.   So I've updated my copy of CursorThreadFunc to take the return value of the SemWaitEvent() call into
    account, so the update will also happen if the event is signaled.  Can't think of a reason why they wouldn't have done
    this in the first place.  Here's the entire function to copy/paste into place:
    
    function CursorThreadFunc(P: Pointer): Longint;
    var
      LastX, LastY: Longint;
    begin
      LastX := -1;
      LastY := -1;
      repeat
        if SemWaitEvent(semCursor, 300) or (CurXPos <> LastX) or (CurYPos <> LastY) then
          begin
            DoSetCursorPosition;
            LastX := CurXPos;
            LastY := CurYPos;
          end;
      until tidCursor = -2;
      tidCursor := -1;
    end;
    
Step 5) Build new EXEs

	Run BUILDBP.CMD to build the DOS EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Usurper

	Run BUILDVP.CMD to build the WIN32 EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Usurper
