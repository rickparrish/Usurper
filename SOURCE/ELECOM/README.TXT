ELECOM v1.03 - release notes
============================

These communication routines are released as freeware. You are free to do with
these routines whatever you want, but please give me proper credit when you do
use them (a small email to me mentioning that you are using them would be
great as well).

When you make any changes, enhancements or additions, please send me a copy
of the changes so I can include them in the next release.

Have fun,

groeten, Maarten Bekers
